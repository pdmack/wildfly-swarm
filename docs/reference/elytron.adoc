= Elytron configuration 

Elytron by default will generate an audit log to the same directory that a WildFly Swarm application is run. 
However, in some environments (e.g., cloud), it may be necessary to relocate the audit file to a globally writable directory.

Specify the following in your project-defaults.yml:
[source,text]
----
swarm:
  elytron:
    file-audit-logs:
      local-audit:
        path: /tmp/audit.log
----
